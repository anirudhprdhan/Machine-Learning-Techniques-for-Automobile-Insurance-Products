# Machine-Learning-Techniques-for-Automobile-Insurance-Products

Automobile insurance is a contract between the buyer and the insurance company that protects the user against any financial loss in the event of an accident or theft. As many individuals are buying various Automobile insurance policies, they are not sure what insurance type to buy for a certain type of vehicle. There are many constraints that play an important role in the buying of insurance. The work has been done in order to provide the user with the best insurance that he/she can buy in case of a new vehicle being bought. The mini-project focused on creating an environment where a user could enter the details and the model would predict the best policy type for an individual using a certain dataset.

The front end has been created using javascript and html files.
The backend uses Python as the language for training the dataset using various machine-learning techniques from the sklearn package.

**Dataset used**: [Insurance Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranja7/vehicle-insurance-customer-data)

**Outcome**

The mini-project aimed to provide users with guidance on the best insurance policy to purchase for a new vehicle. Given the constraints that affect the buying decision, the project used machine learning techniques to predict the ideal policy type based on the userâ€™s input data.
